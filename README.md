# Project 4 - Laundry Service Landing Page

## What I Learned and Implemented

- **HTML:**
  - Used semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`.
  - Structured navigation menu with `<ul>` and `<li>`.
  - Added image with `alt` attribute for accessibility.
  - Used headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), buttons (`<button>`), and spans (`<span>`) for content and styling.

- **CSS:**
  - Applied universal selector (`*`) to reset margin, padding and set `box-sizing: border-box`.
  - Used font families globally and specifically for headings and paragraphs.
  - Managed layout with `float` and `width` percentages for left and right sections.
  - Styled navigation bar with inline and inline-block elements.
  - Created button styles with background color, border radius, borders, and font styles.
  - Used margin and padding for spacing elements properly.
  - Added hover effect (commented out) for buttons to improve interactivity.
  - Highlighted specific text inside headings with a different color using `<span>`.

- **General:**
  - Kept HTML and CSS code clean and well-commented for readability.
  - Maintained original styles without altering any property during cleanup.
  - Ensured responsive layout by using relative units and floats.
